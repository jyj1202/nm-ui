# Quick Start

## NM UI Version
NM UI is currently in rapid development and iteration.

## Using Package Manager
We recommend using a package manager (such as NPM, Yarn, or pnpm) to install NM UI, and then you can use a bundler like Vite or webpack.

```bash
# Choose your favorite package manager
npm install @jyj/nm-ui --save

yarn add @jyj/nm-ui

pnpm install @jyj/nm-ui --save

```
If your network environment is not good, it is recommended to use relevant mirror services like cnpm or the China NPM mirror.

## Usage

### Complete Import
If you don't care much about the size of the bundled files, using complete import will be more convenient.
